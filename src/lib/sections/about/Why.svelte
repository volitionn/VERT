		<b>File converters have always disappointed us.</b> They're ugly,
		riddled with ads, and most importantly; slow. We decided to solve this
		problem once and for all by making an alternative that solves all those
		problems, and more.<br />
		<br />
		All non-video files are converted completely on-device; this means that there's
		no delay between sending and receiving the files from a server, and we never
		get to snoop on the files you convert.
		<br />
		<br />
		Your videos stay on there for an hour, or after they're converted (in the
		case of the input which you upload) or downloaded (in the case of the output
		which is to be downloaded), whichever comes first.
